# MP3Converter
A youtube video to mp3 converter that uses Node.js and mySQL along with other various tools.
In this project I use node.js along with mySQL to build a website that has 4 webpages--Login, Register, View Profile, and Convert. The login and register system is made using Passport. When a user makes an account, their information including username, password, gmail, and user id are uploaded into a mySQL table, where the data is later pulled out and displayed on the view account page. For the Youtube to MP3 converter I used a youtube downloader api.
